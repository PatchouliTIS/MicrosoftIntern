# Introduction 
In STCA deep ranking team, we created many Aether modules. This repo will be used to host source code of all these modules. It could help us to better maintain these modules, and could help us to improve module qualities.

When add module code to this repo, it is recommended to put all required code here. That is to say, the module could be re-created with the code in this repo.

# Folder structure
When adding module code to this repo, it is recommended to organize them as below.

```
root folder
|- README.md
|- Modules
   |- Module 1
      |- README.md (a description)
      |- aether_experiment (a link to an existing Aether experiment which uses this module)
      |- module_id
      |- other_repo  (if it is previously in other repo, put its link here)
      |- src
   |- Module 2
```
